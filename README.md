# video_subtitle_generator

## Accredition:

- Will be updated soon after a stable release

## Pressing Issues

- Resolving the unalignment between the font height and font size (may need a sequential solver)
- The font drawn by PIL library is tricky that some spacing on top is included as the font height.

## If you want to try

1. Git clone this directory:
   `git clone https://github.com/alex-au-922/video_subtitle_generator.git -o <the_directory_you_want>`
2. Install python (If you haven't!)

3. Install the necessary modules using pip:
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`

4. Run the PyQt app!
   `python3 app.py`
